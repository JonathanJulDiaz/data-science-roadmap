# Formatted Strings are strings that have placeholders for variables
# We can use the f-string to format a string
name = 'John'
age = 30

# We use {} to place the variable inside the string
message = f'Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.'

print(message) # This will print: Hello, John. You are 30 years old.
