# In the function we can use the keyword return to return a value
# This value will be returned to the caller of the function

# For example, if we want to return the sum of two numbers
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b # This will sum the two numbers and return the result

print(f"The sum of 2 and 3 is: {sum(2, 3)}")
