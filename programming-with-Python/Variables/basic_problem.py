# The patient, John Doe, comes into the clinic complaining of feeling very hot,
# experiencing chills, and having a high fever. The nurse takes his vital signs
# and records the necessary information. John is also asked whether he has
# social security for insurance purposes.

# Write a Python program that uses variables to store the patient's name,
# temperature, and insurance status. The program should then print a report
# that includes the patient's name, age, temperature(in celsius), and insurance status.

# Solution

name = "John Doe"
age = 30
temperature = 39.2
has_insurance = True

print("Patient Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Temperature(Celsius):", temperature)
print("Has Insurance:", has_insurance)
