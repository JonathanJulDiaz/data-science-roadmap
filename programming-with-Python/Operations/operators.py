# In python we can use differents operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values,
# to compare values and return a boolean result,
# to assign values to variables,
# and are used to control the flow of a program

# Arithmetic Operators: This operators are used to perform arithmetic operations
# + Addition
print(f'Addition: {2 + 3}')
# - Subtraction
print(f'Subtraction: {2 - 3}')
# * Multiplication
print(f'Multiplication: {2 * 3}')
# / Division
print(f'Division: {2 / 3}')
# % Modulus
print(f'Modulus: {9 % 3}')
# ** Exponentiation
print(f'Exponentiation: {2 ** 3}')
# // Floor Division
print(f'Floor Division: {2 // 3}')

print()

# Assignment Operators: This operators are used to assign values to variables
# = Assignment
number = 10
print(f'Number: {number}')
# += Addition Assignment
number += 5
print(f'Added 5: {number}')
# -= Subtraction Assignment
number -= 5
print(f'Subtracted 5: {number}')
# *= Multiplication Assignment
number *= 5
print(f'Multiplied 5: {number}')
# /= Division Assignment
number /= 5
print(f'Divided 5: {number}')
# %= Modulus Assignment
number %= 5
print(f'Modulus 5: {number}')
# **= Exponentiation Assignment
number **= 5
print(f'Exponentiation 5: {number}')
# //= Floor Division Assignment(Divide and round the result down to the nearest whole number)
number //= 5
print(f'Floor Division 5: {number}')

print()

# Comparison Operators: This operators are used to compare values and return a boolean result
# > Greater than
print(f'2 > 3: {2 > 3}')
# < Less than
print(f'2 < 3: {2 < 3}')
# >= Greater than or equal to
print(f'2 >= 3: {2 >= 3}')
# <= Less than or equal to
print(f'2 <= 3: {2 <= 3}')
# == Equal to
print(f'2 == 3: {2 == 3}')
# != Not equal to
print(f'2 != 3: {2 != 3}')

print()

# Logical Operators: This operators are used to associate boolean values and return a boolean result
# and
print(True and False)
# or(This is an inclusive or)
print(True or False)
# not
print(not True)
